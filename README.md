# Landmark Recognition TensorFlow Lite Demo App

This Android app demonstrates landmark recognition using TensorFlow Lite. It allows users to capture images and identify prominent landmarks within those images. The app utilizes a pre-trained deep learning model for efficient and accurate landmark detection.

## Features:

- **Image Capture**: Use the device camera to capture images of landmarks.
- **Real-time Inference**: The app performs real-time inference using the TensorFlow Lite model.
- **Landmark Identification**: Detects and provide landmarks of input image.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive UI for a seamless experience.

## Getting Started:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Build and run the app on an Android device or emulator.

## Dependencies:

- TensorFlow Lite: Used for running the pre-trained model.
- Android CameraX: For capturing images.
- Material Components: Provides UI components.

## Model Details:

The model used is landmark recognition which can downloaded from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/models/google/landmarks"> Here </a>
